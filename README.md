ðŸ’¬ What if your portfolio could actually talk to you?
 Wellâ€¦ mine does now! ðŸš€
I wanted my portfolio to do more than just display my work â€” I wanted it to talk, answer questions, and create a personalized experience for anyone visiting it.
So, I built this project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and integrated the Google Gemini API to power a chatbot that responds to questions about my:
 âœ… Projects
 âœ… Skills
 âœ… Certifications
And the chatbot doesnâ€™t just give generic answers â€” it responds as if youâ€™re chatting directly with me.
 ðŸ“Œ Key Features:
AI Chatbot Integration: Ask about my work, and it will answer in detail.
Mobile-Friendly & Responsive: Smooth experience on all screen sizes ðŸ“±ðŸ’»
Dark Mode: Comfortable browsing anytime ðŸŒ™
Firebase Deployment: Fast, reliable hosting âš¡
Modern, Clean Interface: Simple navigation and engaging layout.
This project combines frontend development, AI integration, and cloud deployment to turn a portfolio into an interactive conversation rather than a static page.
